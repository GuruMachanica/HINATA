# Roadmap

AVATAR is a **local-first** VRM companion: thin presenter first, then adapters (agents, local inference, hardware). Open issues in brackets; vision items may not have tickets yet.

---

## Next

Near-term product work on the desktop companion.

### Motion & triggers

- [x] Local agent/event bus so external tools can drive the avatar (#6, #55)
- [ ] Keyword → animation mapping table (#7) — thin consumer of the bus; intent detection stays pluggable
- [ ] Additive Animations menu — keep bundled clips, append custom, scroll + search (#46)
- [ ] Optional idle VRMA loop (#8)
- [ ] VRM facial expressions (presets + triggers) (#43)

### Voice & presence

- [x] Reactive glass-bar live dot (amplitude + capture status) (#42, #54)
- [ ] Improve lip-sync beyond amplitude cycling (#9) — phase-1 Voice Sensitivity / Mouth limit shipped in v0.8.0 (#67)
- [x] Clearer capture-permission and privacy copy (#12)

### Appearance & performance

- [ ] Avatar thumbnail follow-ups (pre-warm, sidecars, cache prune) (#21)
- [ ] Cap stage WebGL DPR + low-power preference (#48)
- [ ] Environments accordion flicker (still open after picker posters) (#22)
- [ ] Optionally re-encode / shorten bundled stage env GIFs (Code / Bloom) — stage RAM follow-up from #22 / #49

### Quality & docs

- [ ] Docs visual overhaul (reshoot screenshots / GIFs, layout rules) (#33)
- [ ] Editorial pass — consistency, install path, dead ends (#14)
- [ ] Label usage guide for triage (#29)
- [x] SECURITY.md vulnerability reporting (#26)
- [x] Asset license audit + machine-readable manifest (#11)
- [ ] Harden VRoid Hub VRM download for restrictive networks / CDN paths

### Distribution

- [ ] Code-signed Windows installer (#5)
- [ ] Public product site + launch / coverage push
- [ ] Microsoft Store packaging (after signing)

---

## Later / vision

Longer arc — plug-and-play adapters, not hard-coded models. See also [Your AI Needs a Physical Social Life](https://substack.com/@rosspeili/p-193057407).

### Local AI interface

- [ ] Ollama adapter (local LLM) as a first-class “brain” source
- [ ] Local voice-model adapter (TTS/STT pipeline beyond system audio capture)
- [ ] Pluggable Ollama → voice → avatar → optional local DB pipeline
- [ ] Parse local inference streams for keywords / tones → mapped events (anim / expression)
- [ ] Optional semantic / embedding triggers on top of the bus (#7 follow-up)

### Hardware / edge

- [ ] Slim / compact build path for low-resource devices
- [ ] Raspberry Pi / edge Linux companion (offline-capable)
- [ ] ESP32 + CYD (or similar) display mode — UI on device, inference on host first
- [ ] Fully edge offline path when the board can run the stack

### Personalization ecosystem

- [ ] Cosmetics / skins layer beyond current VRM samples
- [ ] Shareable customization packs (avatars, expressions, animations, cosmetics)
- [ ] “Companion gadget” framing: collect, customize, carry

### Social / ALS

- [ ] Social layer for autonomous logical systems (physical / social presence)
